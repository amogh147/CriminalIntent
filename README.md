# CriminalIntent
CS528-Project2

Modifications in CriminalIntent app from chapter 16 of "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide" (2nd Edition) book


MODIFICATIONS
1- Currently, the app can only store one image in the top left corner. Taking a second image replaces the first image with the second. Make it possible to store more images below the "SEND CRIME REPORT" button as shown below. Taking images 2,3 and 4 should store those images in the positions below the "SEND CRIME REPORT" button as shown.

2- If 4 images are already displayed, taking a 5th image should replace image 1 (in top left corner). Taking a 6th image replaces image 2 (leftmost image below the "SEND CRIME REPORT" button) and so on.

3- Add a "DELETE ALL IMAGES" button. Pressing this button should delete all previously displayed images and no images should be displayed thereafter.
